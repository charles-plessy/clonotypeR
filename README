clonotypeR is distributed as a R package, as a full source archive that
contains more example data and the source of the website, or as a Git
repository.

If you do not see directories such as `doc` (containing a wiki documentation)
or `example_data` (containing 6,000 sequences in FASTQ format for testing
purposes), then you can get them from the full source archive or the Git
repository.
