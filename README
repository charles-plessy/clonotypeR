clonotypeR is distributed as a R package, as a full source archive that
contains more example data and the source of the website, or as a Git
repository.

If you do not see directories such as `doc` (containing a wiki documentation)
or `example_data` (containing 6,000 sequences in FASTQ format for testing
purposes), then you can get them from the full source archive or the Git
repository.

clonotypeR is developed in the RIKEN Yokohama institute by the Functional
Genomics Technology Team of the Omics Science Center, and by the Division of
Genomics Technologies of the Center for Life Science Technologies, in
collaboration with the Research Unit for Immune Homeostasis of the Research
Center for Allergy and Immunology.  It was supported by a research grant from
the Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology
(MEXT) for the RIKEN Omics Science Center to Yoshihide Hayashizaki, and and by
a research grant from MEXT to the RIKEN Center for Life Science Technologies.
