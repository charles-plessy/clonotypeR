Distribution
============

_clontoypeR_ is distributed as a R package, as a full source archive that
contains more example data and the source of the website, or as a Git
repository.

If you do not see directories such as `doc` (containing a wiki documentation)
or `example_data` (containing 6,000 sequences in FASTQ format for testing
purposes), then you can get them from the full source archive or the Git
repository.


Installation
============

### R package

(Sumbmitted to a package archive)


### From file archive

Download _clonotypeR_ as a [source archive](http://source.clonotyper.branchable.com/?p=source.git;a=tree;h=refs/heads/release;hb=refs/heads/release)
and install it as explained above.
The full source of this package is available as a Git repository
at the following URL.

    git://clonotyper.branchable.com/


### From source repository

Install the requirements below, and then clone *clonotypeR* with [git](http://git-scm.com/), then build and install the R module

<pre>
git clone git://clonotyper.branchable.com/ clonotyper
R CMD build clonotyper
R CMD INSTALL clonotypeR_0.9.tar.gz  # Adjust for the correct version number
</pre>

See the example analysis of [[doc/examples/GSE35626]] for a more detailed walkthrough.


Requirements
============

Run-time requirements
---------------------

 * [EMBOSS][], to manipulate the reference sequences.
 * [BWA][] (Burrows-Wheeler Aligner), to identify the trimmed V segments.
 * [BioPerl][] (> 1.6.9), to translate the CDRs.  Lower versions differ on how they translate incomplete last codons.
 * [R][] for creating expression tables and analysing them.

Other requirements
------------------

 * [sff_extract][], to [[convert|doc/FASTQ]] the 454 SFF files to FASTQ format.
 * [Biostrings][], to refresh the R tables containging the *V* and *J* segment sequence boundaries.
 * [Pandoc][] is needed for building the manual page of `clonotypeR`.
