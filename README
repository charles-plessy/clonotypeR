clonotypeR is distributed as a R package, as a full source archive that
contains more example data and the source of the website, or as a Git
repository.

If you do not see directories such as `doc` (containing a wiki documentation)
or `example_data` (containing 6,000 sequences in FASTQ format for testing
purposes), then you can get them from the full source archive or the Git
repository.

clonotypeR is developed in the RIKEN Yokohama institute by the Functional
Genomics Technology Team of the Omics Science Center, in collaboration with the
Research Unit for Immune Homeostasis of the Research Center for Allergy and
Immunology.  It was supported by a research grant from the Japanese Ministry of
Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) to Yoshihide Hayashizaki.
