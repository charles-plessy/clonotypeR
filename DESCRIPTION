Description: High throughput analysis of T cell antigen receptor sequences
 The genes encoding T cell receptors are created by somatic recombination,
 generating an immense combination of V, (D) and J segments.  Additional
 processes during the recombination create extra sequence diversity between the
 V an J segments.  Collectively, this hyper-variable region is called the CDR3
 loop.
 .
 The purpose of this package is to process and quantitatively analyse millions
 of V-CDR3-J combination, called clonotypes, from multiple sequence libraries.
