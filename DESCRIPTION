Description: Identify and analyse B and T cell receptors at a high throughput.
 The genes encoding T cell receptors and B cell receptors (the antibodies) are created
 by somatic recombination, generating an immense combination of V, (D) and J segments.
 Additional processes during the recombination create extra sequence diversity between
 the V an J segments.  Collectively, this hyper-variable region is called the CDR3 loop.
 .
  The purpose of this package is to process and quantitatively analyse millions of
 V-CDR3-J combination, called clonotypes, from multiple libraries.
