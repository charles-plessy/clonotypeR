# Clonotypes

In the immune system, the *T cells* and *B cells* (or lymphocytes)
recognize their targets by producing a large number of variable
receptors, where the sequence diversity, not encoded directly in the
germ line, originates through [[!wikipedia V(D)J_recombination
desc="somatic recombination"]].  Each B or T cell expresses only one
receptor variant, and the collection of all the different receptors in
a cell population is called a *repertoire*.  Once the somatic
recombination is done, the receptor is transmitted to daughter cells
across divisions, and the collection of cells expressing the same
receptor, and by extension the receptor itself, is called a
*clonotype*.

The processus of somatic recombination assembles a mature gene from
arrays of *segments* on the genome.  The junction between the
N-terminal *V* and the downstream *J* segments, with the possible
inclusion of a *D* segment in the case of the T cell receptor Î²
chain and the immunoglobulin heavy chain, is called the
[[!wikipedia complementarity_determining_region desc="complementarity determining region 3"]]
(*CDR3*) and is one of the key contact points with the antigen.

In *clonotypeR*, we define clonotypes as unique combinations of *V*,
*CDR3* and *J* segments at the nucleotide or protein level.  The *V*
and *J* segments are encoded in the genome and are therefore called by
their name, and the *CDR3* region is identified by its sequence.  For
instance, each of the following lines define a different clonotype,
not considering synonymous differences in the DNA sequence.

We use as boundaries between the *V*, *CDR3* and *J* segments the
*conserved cystein* and the *FGxG* motif, which we do not include in
the *CDR3*.
