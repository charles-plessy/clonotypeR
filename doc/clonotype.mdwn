# Clonotypes

The adaptive immune system cells recognize their targets by producing
a large number of variable receptors, where the sequence diversity,
not encoded directly in the germ line, originates through
*somatic recombination*.  Each B or T lymphocyte express only one
receptor variant, and the collection of all the different receptors in
a cell population is called a *repertoire*.  Once the somatic
recombination is done, the receptor is transmitted to daughter cells
across divisions, and the collection of cells expressing the same
receptor, and by extension the receptor itself, is called a
*clonotype*.

The processus of somatic recombination assembles a mature gene from
arrays of *segments* on the genome.  The junction between the N-terminal *V* and
the downstream *J* segments, with the possible inclusion of a
*D* segment in the case of the T cell receptor beta chain and the
immunoglobulin heavy chain, is called the *complementarity
determining region 3* (*CDR3*) and is one of the key contact points
with the antigen.  The somatic recombination is imprecise and
therefore the sequence of the CDR3 has to be determined
experimentally.  Flanking the CDR3, there are two structural motifs
that are essential for the receptor's function and therefore strongly
conserved: a *cysteine* at the end of the *V* segment and a *FGxG* motif
(\cite{Lefranc1999}) in the *J* segment.  Characterizing the receptor
clonotype diversity requires the identification of the *V*, *(D)* and *J*
segments as well as sequencing the *CDR3* region.
