# Alignment of V and J segements with SeaView.

_Page in construction…_

[SeaView](http://doua.prabi.fr/software/seaview) is a “multiplatform, graphical
user interface for multiple sequence alignment and molecular phylogeny”.  In
addition to the traditional display of nucleotides, it can color the alignment
by codons, or display the DNA sequence translated as protein.  This makes it
very useful for manual alignemnt of _V_ and _J_ segments.
