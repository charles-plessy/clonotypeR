[SeaView](http://doua.prabi.fr/software/seaview) is a “multiplatform, graphical
user interface for multiple sequence alignment and molecular phylogeny”.  In
addition to the traditional display of nucleotides, it can color the alignment
by codons, or display the DNA sequence translated as protein.  This makes it
very useful for manual alignemnt of _V_ and _J_ segments.

### Nucleotide view

J segments must be aligned on the `FGxG` motif, but in the default view it is 
not very obvious to see.  Switch to the codon view or the aminoacid view.

### Codon view

Here, the `FGxG` motif stands out like for example “<span style="background: red; font-family: monospace">TTC</span><span style="background: lime; font-family: monospace">GGT</span><span style="background: olive; font-family: monospace">CAT</span><span style="background: lime; font-family: monospace">GGA</span>”.  This mode is very useful for finding the relevant reading frame, by adding or removing gaps before the first nucleotide.

### Aminoacid view

This mode is very useful for aligning in-frame sequences, checking the final alignment, and spotting easily the stop codons in pseudogenised segments.
