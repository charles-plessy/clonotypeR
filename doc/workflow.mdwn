clonotypeR's workflow
=====================

*(draft)*

Data preparation in the command line
------------------------------------

*clonotypeR* is ran with three commands.

 - `clonotyper convert` transfroms sequencer ouptut files, currently in *ab1* (Sanger chromatograms) or *sff* (454 sequencer ouptut) format, to the stardard [[!wikipedia Fastq desc="FASTQ"]] format.

 - `clonotyper detect` compares the sequences to a reference database of V segments.

 - `clonotyper extract` searches for J segments in sequences where a V segment was found, extracts the CDR3s and reports the results in a table ready to be loaded in R by the [[`read.clonotypes()`|html/read.clonotypes.html]] function.

See the [[manual page|scripts/clonotyper]] for more details.


Data analysis in R
------------------

The R module can be loaded with the following command.

<pre>
