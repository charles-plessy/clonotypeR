# NAME

clonotyper - Quantitative analysis of antigen receptor sequences

# SYNOPSIS

clonotypeR detect  library1.fastq library2.fastq ...

clonotypeR extract library1 library2 ...
# DESCRIPTION

## clonotypeR detect

Detects the *V* segments using the `bwa bwasw`.  This command uses by default as many threads as possible (see `THREADS`).

## clonotypeR extract

Extracts the CDR3s and records the clonotypes in one file per library.  This command is not running threaded programs, so
there may be a benefit running multiple extractions in parallel. 

# OPTIONS

*ClonotypeR*'s options are passed as environment variables.

## CLONOTYPER_REFERENCE

Path to reference alignments.  If not set, a `references` directory is searched in `/etc`, `/usr/share/clontyper`, and then in the parent directory.

## CLONOTYPER_SCRIPTS

Path to *clonotypeR*'s accessory scripts.  If not set, a `scripts` directory is searched in `/usr/share/clontyper`, and then in the parent directory.

## CLONOTYPES

Path to the directory where the clonotypes are to be extracted.

Default: `./clonotypes`

## DEBUG

Save intermediate files (`vectorstrip` output) for troubleshooting.

Default: unset

## EXTRACT_DIR

Path to the BAM and temporary files.  Default: `./extraction_files`

## TMPDIR

Use the directory indicated by `TMPDIR` to store temporary files.

## THREADS

Number of threads for the alignment 

## VS_MISMATCH

Percentage of mismatches tolerated when detecting the boundaries of the CDR3 region.  The alignment is made with 20 base pairs.

Default: 0
