Tested against 2.15.2 (latest version packaged in Debian).

NOTE: "no visible binding for global variable ‘clonotypes’"
  The goal here is to have the functions work by default of a data frame called
  ‘clonotypes’ when no data frame is passed.

Version starting from 0.99.1 because I already released 0.99.0 with errors
accidentally.
