clonotypeR: Identify and analyse B and T cell receptors at a high throughput
============================================================================

*clonotypeR* is a R package and accompanying scripts to identify and
analyse clonotypes from high-throughput T cell receptors sequence
libraries. *clonotypeR* is suited to process and organise very large
number of clonotypes, in the order of millions, typically produced by
Roche 454 instruments, and to prepare these sequences for differential
expression analysis with the typical transcriptomics tools as well as
for statistical analysis using existing R packages.

*clonotypeR* is documented on line at [http://clonotyper.branchable.com/]()
