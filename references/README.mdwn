Reference sequences
===================

The references sequences are TRA@.gb, TRB@.gb and TRG@.gb, from GenBank.
<code>make gb2fa</code> will extract V, (D), J and C segments with the
<code>extractfeat</code> command of the EMBOSS package. 

This directory contains V and J segments aligned on conserved motifs in the
files V.fa and J.fa.  These alignments were made by hand using [SeaView][] and
may need to be revised when the reference sequences change.

[SeaView]:	http://pbil.univ-lyon1.fr/software/seaview	"multiplatform, graphical user interface for multiple sequence alignment and molecular phylogeny."

Identical V segments need to be collated together.  The problem is that wich
ones are indentical depend on how the PCR primers used to amplfiy them
were designed.

The files V-C.fa, V_after_C.fa, J-FGxG.fa, J_before_FGxG.fa are derived from
the manually edited files V.fa and J.fa described above, by removing everything
after or before their conserved motif, followed by degapping by a command such
as:

  degapseq V-C.fa V-C.fa.degapped && mv V-C.fa.degapped V-C.fa

A BWA index is provided for the V segments trunkated after the conserved
cysteine, in the ‘V’ directory, and can be refreshed with the command
<code>make bwa-index</code>.
