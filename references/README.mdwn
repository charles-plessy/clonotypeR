Reference sequences
===================

The references sequences are TRA@.gb, TRB@.gb and TRG@.gb, from GenBank.  The
*V*, *(D)*, *J* and *C* segments were extracted with the command `make gb2fa`,
wich uses the the [extractfeat][] program of the EMBOSS package. 

This directory contains *V* and *J* segments aligned on conserved motifs in the
files [[V.fa]] and [[J.fa]].  These alignments were made by hand using [SeaView][] and
may need to be revised when the reference sequences change.

Identical *V* segments need to be collated together.  One problem is that which
ones are indentical depends on how the PCR primers used to amplfiy them were
designed.  You may need to adjust the reference files accordingly.

The files [[V-C.fa]], [[V_after_C.fa]], [[J-FGxG.fa]], [[J_before_FGxG.fa]] are
derived from the manually edited files [[V.fa]] and [[J.fa]] described above,
by removing everything after or before their conserved motif, followed by
degapping by a command such as:

`degapseq V-C.fa V-C.fa.degapped && mv V-C.fa.degapped V-C.fa`

A BWA index is provided for the *V* segments trunkated after the conserved
cysteine, in the `V` directory, and can be refreshed with the command `make
bwa-index`.  It is used by the command `clonotypeR detect`.
