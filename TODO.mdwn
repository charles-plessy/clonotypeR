To do
=====

Reference sequences
-------------------

 * Add B cell receptors.

 * Add a make target to refresh the reference sequences from RefSeq.

 * Support multiple organisms.

 * Define a versionned CDR3 file format and test it before reading in [[R/read.clonotypes.R]]

read.clonotypes: do not hardcode column classe, but infer them from the name, that is inferred from the OSC header, or hardcoded as a fallback.


Define
##ProtocolREF = CP-Custom-v1.0

Correct in OSC file
##ParameterValue[qual] = Illumina
Is it correct to have same name for ParameterValue and ColumnName ?

Do we need ?
##NameSpace = genomic_coordinate

 * Provide example AB1 and SFF files.

Get good default for CLONOTYPER_REFERENCE and other variables.

Regression tests: make sure that the example data has a sharp sign in the FASTQ sequence (if valid), and
compare the number of lines to what is expected.
