To do
=====

Reference sequences
-------------------

 * Add B cell receptors.

 * Add a make target to refresh the reference sequences from RefSeq.

 * Support multiple organisms.

 * Define a versionned CDR3 file format and test it before reading in [[R/read_clonotypes.R]]

read_clonotypes: do not hardcode column classe, but infer them from the name, that is inferred from the OSC header, or hardcoded as a fallback.

OSCTable support
----------------

Define

`##ProtocolREF = CP-Custom-v1.0`

Correct in OSC file

`##ParameterValue[qual] = Illumina`

Is it correct to have same name for ParameterValue and ColumnName ?

Do we need ?

`##NameSpace = genomic_coordinate`

 * Provide example AB1 and SFF files.

Others
------

Get good default for CLONOTYPER_REFERENCE and other variables.

Regression tests: make sure that the example data has a sharp sign in the FASTQ sequence (if valid), and
compare the number of lines to what is expected.

Support extraction of barcoded reads.

Report the number of V segments found after `clonotypeR detect`.
