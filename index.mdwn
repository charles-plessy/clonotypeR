clontoypeR â€“ Quantitative analysis of antigen receptor sequences
================================================================

*clontotypeR* is a R package and accompanying scripts to identify
and analyse [[clonotypes|doc/clonotype]] from high-throughput T cell receptors sequence libraries.
*clonotypeR* is suited to process and organise very large number of clonotypes,
in the order of millions, typically produced by Roche 454 instruments, and to
prepare these sequences for differential expression analysis with the typical
transcriptomics tools as well as for statistical analysis using existing R packages.

*clonotypeR* is developed in the [RIKEN Yokohama institute][RIKEN-Yokohama] by
the [Functional Genomics Technology Team][FGTT] of the [Omics Science
Center][OSC], in collaboration with the [Research Unit for Immune
Homeostasis][RUIH] of the [Research Center for Allergy and Immunology][RCAI].
