Changes in version 1.10.0

OTHER CHANGES

    o   Minor metadata updates.

Changes in version 1.8.0

NEW FEATURES

    o   Added a “private_clonotypes” function.

Changes in version 1.4.0

BUG FIXES

    o   Minor packaging corrections (NAMESPACE, etc.).

Changes in version 1.2.0

NEW FEATURES

    o   Added a “long” option to yassai_identifier(), where every amino acid is
        represented.  This solves the problem of ID collisions, where a single
        identifier could be produced by two different clonotypes.

    o   Added a new option to clonotype_table() for randomly sampling libraries.

    o   Added a new mode to common_clonotypes() for calculating the abundance
        relatively to one library.

    o   Unified the syntax of common_clonotypes() and unique_clonotypes().

BUG FIXES

    o   Removed infinite loop in yassai_identifier() when the germinal V
        sequence was completely absent from the CDR3.

    o   Corrected output bug where “integer(0)” was returned if the V–J
        boundary was a codon boundary.

    o   yassai_identifier(): properly encode the names of the V and J segments.

Changes in version 1.0.0

    o   Initial release in Bioconductor.
