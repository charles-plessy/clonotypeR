Installation
============

### R package

The `R` package is also distributed on
[Bioconductor](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/clonotypeR.html).
It only contains the `R` code to analyse the clonotypes extracted by the
scripts for processing the raw sequences, which are to be downloaded as
explained below.


### From source repository

Install the requirements below, and then clone *clonotypeR* with [git](http://git-scm.com/), then build and install the R module

<pre>
git clone git://clonotyper.branchable.com/ clonotyper
R CMD build clonotyper
R CMD INSTALL clonotypeR_0.9.tar.gz  # Adjust for the correct version number
</pre>

See the example analysis of [[doc/examples/GSE35626]] for a more detailed walkthrough.


Requirements
============

Run-time requirements
---------------------

 * [EMBOSS][], to manipulate the reference sequences.
 * [BWA][] (Burrows-Wheeler Aligner), to identify the trimmed V segments.
 * [BioPerl][] (> 1.6.9), to translate the CDRs.  Lower versions differ on how they translate incomplete last codons.
 * [R][] for creating expression tables and analysing them.

Other requirements
------------------

 * [sff_extract][], to [[convert|doc/FASTQ]] the 454 SFF files to FASTQ format.
 * [Biostrings][], to refresh the R tables containging the *V* and *J* segment sequence boundaries.
 * [Pandoc][] is needed for building the manual page of `clonotypeR`.
